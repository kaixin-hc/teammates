# About
TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other feedback paths of your students.
It is provided as a cloud-based service for educators/students and is currently used by hundreds of universities across the world. Here are more statistics about our project: [Project Stats](https://www.openhub.net/p/teammatesonline).

We welcome contributions from anyone, in particular, students (see [here](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/web/front/about)Â for the list of our contributors). One of the main objectives of TEAMMATES is to help students get experience in an OSS production environment.
